```

## üîß Advanced Techniques

### Custom JavaScript Execution

You can execute complex JavaScript for advanced interactions:

```javascript
// Example: Extract all form data
claude "Execute JavaScript: Array.from(document.forms).map(form => ({ name: form.name, fields: Array.from(form.elements).map(el => el.name) }))"
```

### Chaining Multiple Actions

Combine multiple MCP tools in one request:

```bash
claude "Navigate to login page, fill credentials, submit form, wait for dashboard, take screenshot, then navigate to profile page and screenshot that too"
```

### Resource Management

Access screenshots and console logs as resources:

```bash
# After taking screenshots, ask Claude:
"Show me the screenshot named 'homepage' and summarize what's visible"
"What errors appear in the console logs?"
```

## üöÄ Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Testing

```bash
# Add to your CI/CD pipeline
npm run mcp:workflow test
claude "Navigate to localhost:3000, test main user journeys, report any visual or functional issues"
```

### Bug Report Generation

```bash
# Generate comprehensive bug reports
claude "Navigate to the bug page, screenshot the issue, check console for errors, execute JavaScript to get browser info, compile a detailed bug report"
```

### Feature Verification

```bash
# Verify new features work correctly
claude "Navigate to the new feature page, test all interactive elements, screenshot successful interactions, verify expected behavior"
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Descriptive Screenshot Names**: This makes it easier to reference specific screenshots later
