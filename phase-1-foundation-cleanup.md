# Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup (2-3 Months)

## Overview
This phase focuses on removing over-engineered code, simplifying the architecture, and establishing a clean foundation for the hotspot application. The goal is to reduce the codebase from 31,000+ lines to a manageable, maintainable system.

**Timeline:** 2-3 months  
**Key Objective:** Eliminate technical debt and establish clean architecture  
**No Backward Compatibility:** Clean slate approach - discard all existing projects and broken functionality
