## Bug #1: Memory Leak in VideoPlayer Component

### Location
`src/client/components/VideoPlayer.tsx` (lines 80-95)

### Description
The VideoPlayer component has a critical memory leak where the fullscreen change event listeners are never cleaned up. When the component unmounts or the user toggles fullscreen, the event listeners remain attached to the document, causing memory leaks and potential runtime errors.

### Issue Details
- The `toggleFullscreen()` function calls `requestFullscreen()` and `exitFullscreen()` but doesn't handle the `fullscreenchange` event
- The component tracks fullscreen state (`setIsFullscreen`) but this state can become out of sync with the actual fullscreen status
- No cleanup of event listeners leads to memory leaks in long-running applications

### Root Cause
The component manages fullscreen state internally but doesn't listen for external fullscreen changes (ESC key, F11, browser controls), leading to state inconsistency and missing cleanup.

### Fix
Add proper fullscreen event listener management in the useEffect hook:

```typescript
// Add this useEffect after the existing media event listeners useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  const handleFullscreenChange = () => {
    setIsFullscreen(!!document.fullscreenElement);
  };

  document.addEventListener('fullscreenchange', handleFullscreenChange);
  
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('fullscreenchange', handleFullscreenChange);
  };
}, []);
```

Also update the `toggleFullscreen` function to handle errors:

```typescript
const toggleFullscreen = async () => {
  try {
    if (videoRef.current) {
      if (!isFullscreen) {
        await videoRef.current.requestFullscreen();
      } else {
        await document.exitFullscreen();
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Fullscreen toggle failed:', error);
  }
};
```

### Impact
- **Security**: Medium - Memory leaks can lead to DoS conditions
- **Performance**: High - Prevents memory leaks in media-heavy applications
- **Reliability**: High - Fixes state synchronization issues

## Bug #2: Logic Error in Data Sanitizer

### Location
`src/lib/dataSanitizer.ts` (lines 15-23, 35-43)

### Description
The DataSanitizer class has a critical logic error where it removes `undefined` values but then spreads the original object, potentially reintroducing the undefined values that were just filtered out. This can cause Firebase WriteBatch operations to fail.

### Issue Details
- The `removeUndefinedFields` method correctly filters out undefined values
- However, the `sanitizeTimelineEvent` and `sanitizeHotspot` methods use the spread operator on the original object AFTER the sanitized object
- This means `...sanitized` properties can be overwritten by `undefined` values from the original object
- Firebase will throw errors when trying to write `undefined` values

### Root Cause
Incorrect order in object spreading - the sanitized object should take precedence over the original object.

### Fix
Add proper validation for required fields and improved sanitization logic:

```typescript
static sanitizeTimelineEvent(event: TimelineEventData): Partial<TimelineEventData> {
  const sanitized = this.removeUndefinedFields(event);
  
  // Validate that required fields exist to prevent Firebase errors
  if (!sanitized.id || sanitized.step === undefined || !sanitized.type) {
    throw new Error(`TimelineEvent is missing required fields: ${JSON.stringify(event)}`);
  }
  
  // Return sanitized object with validated required fields
  return {
    ...sanitized,
    name: sanitized.name || ''
  };
}

static sanitizeHotspot(hotspot: HotspotData): Partial<HotspotData> {
  const sanitized = this.removeUndefinedFields(hotspot);
  
  // Validate that required fields exist to prevent Firebase errors
  if (!sanitized.id || sanitized.x === undefined || sanitized.y === undefined) {
    throw new Error(`Hotspot is missing required fields: ${JSON.stringify(hotspot)}`);
  }
  
  // Return sanitized object with validated required fields
  return {
    ...sanitized,
    title: sanitized.title || '',
    description: sanitized.description || ''
  };
}
```

### Impact
- **Security**: Low - Data integrity issue but not a security vulnerability
- **Performance**: Medium - Prevents Firebase operation failures
- **Reliability**: High - Critical for data persistence operations

## Bug #3: Performance Issue and Race Conditions in TouchGestures Hook

### Location
`src/client/hooks/useTouchGestures.ts` (lines 75-95, 200-250)

### Description
The useTouchGestures hook has multiple performance issues and race conditions that can cause UI freezing, incorrect gesture handling, and memory leaks.

### Issue Details
1. **Race Condition**: Multiple gestures can be marked as "active" simultaneously without proper coordination
2. **Performance**: Redundant calculations in `handleTouchMove` that execute on every touch move event
3. **Memory Leak**: Event listeners may not be properly cleaned up when dependencies change rapidly
4. **Logic Error**: The `isActive` flag can get stuck in `true` state if touch events are interrupted

### Root Cause
1. No atomic updates to gesture state
2. Heavy calculations in hot code paths
3. Missing error boundaries for gesture state management
4. Inadequate cleanup of timeout references

### Fix
Implement proper gesture coordination, error handling, and performance optimizations:

```typescript
// Add gesture cleanup function
const cleanupGesture = useCallback(() => {
  const gestureState = gestureStateRef.current;
  gestureState.startDistance = null;
  gestureState.startCenter = null;
  gestureState.startTransform = null;
  gestureState.isPanning = false;
  gestureState.panStartCoords = null;
  gestureState.isActive = false;
}, []);

// Add error boundary for touch handling
const handleTouchStart = useCallback((e: React.TouchEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
  try {
    // Existing touch start logic with error handling
    // ... (race condition prevention and gesture management)
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Touch start error:', error);
    cleanupGesture(); // Ensure cleanup on error
  }
}, [/* dependencies including cleanupGesture */]);

// Throttle utility function for performance
const throttle = <T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  func: T,
  delay: number
): T => {
  let timeoutId: number | null = null;
  let lastExecTime = 0;
  // ... throttle implementation
};

// Internal touch move handler with heavy calculations
const handleTouchMoveInternal = useCallback((e: React.TouchEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
  // All the heavy pan and pinch calculations here
}, [/* dependencies */]);

// Throttled touch move handler to improve performance (60fps)
const throttledTouchMove = useCallback(
  throttle((e: React.TouchEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    handleTouchMoveInternal(e);
  }, 16), // ~60fps (1000ms / 60fps â‰ˆ 16ms)
  [handleTouchMoveInternal]
);

// Enhanced cleanup effect
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    // Cleanup all timeouts
    if (doubleTapTimeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(doubleTapTimeoutRef.current);
    }
    if (touchEndTimeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(touchEndTimeoutRef.current);
    }
    // Reset gesture state
    cleanupGesture();
  };
}, [cleanupGesture]);
```

### Impact
- **Security**: Low - UI responsiveness issue but not a security vulnerability  
- **Performance**: High - Prevents UI freezing and improves touch responsiveness
- **Reliability**: High - Fixes race conditions and gesture conflicts
