# Actionable Rebuild Plan for ExpliCoLearning

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive, phased plan for rebuilding the ExpliCoLearning application. The primary goal is to create a modern, maintainable, and high-performing application with an exceptional user experience, built upon a **Unified Responsive Architecture**. This plan replaces a sprawling 132-component codebase with a streamlined, "hotspot-only" architecture that is simpler to develop and easier for users to understand.

This is a living document that will be used to track progress. Each phase includes actionable checklists and a clear "Definition of Done" to ensure quality and alignment at every stage.

## 2. Guiding Principles (Mandatory)

This rebuild will strictly adhere to the principles outlined in `AGENTS.md`. All development must follow these non-negotiable rules:

- **Unified Responsive Architecture:** One component must adapt to all screen sizes.
- **CSS-First Design:** Responsiveness will be handled exclusively by Tailwind CSS breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).
- **NO JavaScript Branching for UI:** Device detection (`useDeviceDetection`) is **only** for mathematical calculations (e.g., canvas coordinates), not for rendering different components or styles.
- **NO Separate Mobile/Desktop Components:** All components must be unified.
- **Centralized Z-Index:** All `z-index` values must come from `src/client/utils/zIndexLevels.ts`.
- **Hotspot-Only Architecture:** All interactive elements (text, media, shapes) will be implemented as effects triggered by a single, universal hotspot element.
