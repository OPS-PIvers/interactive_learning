  - ✅ Enhanced timeline scrubber with gradient states

#### **Phase 3: Visual System Implementation**
- [✅] **Color Palette**: Implement purple/blue gradient system
  - ✅ Primary gradients: `from-purple-500 to-blue-500`
  - ✅ Background: Slate backgrounds (`bg-slate-800/50`, `bg-slate-900`)
  - ✅ Accent colors: Purple (`text-purple-400`) and blue (`text-blue-400`)

- [✅] **Typography & Spacing**: Apply consistent design system
  - ✅ Font weights: `font-medium` for labels, `font-semibold` for headers
  - ✅ Spacing: `gap-3`, `p-4`, `px-6 py-3` for consistency
  - ✅ Border radius: `rounded-lg` for containers, `rounded-full` for buttons

- [✅] **Interactive States**: Implement proper state management
  - ✅ Completed state: Checkmark icons with green accents
  - ✅ Active state: Gradient borders and enhanced visibility
  - ✅ Pending state: Subtle opacity and muted colors
  - ✅ Hover effects: Smooth transitions and enhanced contrast

#### **Phase 4: Mobile Optimization**
- [✅] **Touch Interactions**: Ensure mobile-first timeline experience
  - ✅ Minimum 44px touch targets for timeline events
  - ✅ Improved touch feedback with haptic responses
  - ✅ Better spacing for finger navigation
  - ✅ Enhanced gesture support for timeline scrubbing

- [✅] **Responsive Design**: Optimize for different screen sizes
  - ✅ Portrait mode: Vertical timeline layout with proper spacing
  - ✅ Landscape mode: Horizontal timeline with optimized event display
  - ✅ Small screens: Condensed timeline view with essential information
  - ✅ Large screens: Enhanced timeline with preview cards and animations

#### **Phase 5: Animations & Interactions**
- [✅] **Smooth Transitions**: Implement engaging animations
  - ✅ Progress bar animations with `transition-all duration-300`
  - ✅ Event marker animations with scale and opacity changes
  - ✅ Hover effects with smooth color transitions
  - ✅ Timeline scrubbing with real-time visual feedback

- [✅] **Visual Feedback**: Enhance user interaction clarity
  - ✅ Timeline event hover effects with elevation
  - ✅ Progress indicators with gradient animations
  - ✅ Current event highlighting with glow effects
  - ✅ Completion celebrations with check animations

#### **Phase 6: Integration & Testing**
- [✅] **Component Integration**: Ensure timeline works with existing systems
  - ✅ SlideViewer integration with timeline controls
  - ✅ Hotspot interaction coordination with timeline progress
  - ✅ Background media synchronization with timeline events
  - ✅ Mobile modal integration with timeline navigation

- [✅] **Cross-Device Testing**: Verify timeline performance
  - ✅ Mobile device testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
  - ✅ Tablet optimization (iPad, Android tablets)
  - ✅ Desktop browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - ✅ Touch vs. mouse interaction validation

### Technical Requirements

#### **Dependencies & Imports**
- React hooks: `useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`
- Icon components: Existing project icon system
- Animation utilities: CSS transitions and transforms
- Mobile utilities: `useIsMobile`, touch event handling

#### **Styling Patterns**
- Tailwind CSS classes following project conventions
- CSS custom properties for dynamic values
- Backdrop filters for glassmorphism effects
- Gradient utilities for modern visual design

#### **Accessibility Standards**
- ARIA labels for screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation for timeline events
- Focus indicators for interactive elements
- Color contrast compliance for all text

### Success Criteria
- [✅] Timeline visual design matches project's modern aesthetic
- [✅] Smooth animations and interactions across all devices
- [✅] Mobile-first design with optimal touch interactions
- [✅] Consistent visual language with existing UI components
- [✅] Accessibility compliance and keyboard navigation
- [✅] Performance optimization for timeline rendering
