# Legacy Code Cleanup - Unified Architecture Completion

## Overview
Complete the mobile-first unified architecture by removing all legacy mobile/desktop-specific components and their branching logic, replacing them with truly responsive unified components.

## Current Status
-  **ResponsiveCanvas** - Already unified (fixed canvas dimensions and removed isMobile)
-  **ResponsiveToolbar** - Converted to true responsive design 
-  **ResponsiveHeader** - Converted to true responsive design
-  **ResponsiveSlideNavigation** - Already unified, removed unused imports
-  **useUnifiedEditorState** - Removed useIsMobile dependency

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Replace Mobile-Specific Modals (High Priority)
- [✅] **Replace MobileSlidesModal** � Create ResponsiveSlidesModal
- [✅] **Replace MobileBackgroundModal** � Create ResponsiveBackgroundModal  
- [✅] **Replace MobileInsertModal** � Create ResponsiveInsertModal
- [✅] **Replace MobileAspectRatioModal** � Create ResponsiveAspectRatioModal

### Phase 2: Remove Legacy Editor Components (High Priority)
- [✅] **Delete MobileSlideEditor.tsx** - No longer used
- [✅] **Delete TouchAwareSlideEditor.tsx** - No longer used  
- [✅] **Delete SlideBasedEditor.tsx** - Replaced by UnifiedSlideEditor
- [✅] **Update imports** in files that reference these components

### Phase 3: Clean Up Mobile-Specific Utilities (Medium Priority)
- [✅] **Remove UniversalMobileToolbar** - Replace with ResponsiveToolbar usage
- [✅] **Remove MobileEditorToolbarContent** - Functionality moved to ResponsiveToolbar
- [ ] **Clean up mobile state managers** that are no longer needed
- [ ] **Remove mobile-specific hooks** that duplicate responsive logic

### Phase 4: Audit and Remove Unused Components (Medium Priority)
- [✅] **Audit mobile/ directory** - Identify which components are still needed
- [✅] **Remove unused mobile components** - Delete components with no references (removed 5 modal components + MobileHeader)
- [ ] **Convert remaining mobile components** to responsive versions if still needed
- [ ] **Clean up test files** for removed components

### Phase 5: Fix Remaining useIsMobile References (Low Priority)
- [✅] **Audit remaining useIsMobile usage** - Found ~10 files still using it (mostly in viewer components)
- [⏳] **Replace with viewport-based logic** where appropriate - ResponsivePropertiesPanel still uses device detection
- [⏳] **Remove useIsMobile hook** if no longer needed - Still used by some viewer components
- [⏳] **Update component tests** to handle unified responsive behavior - Deferred to separate task

### Phase 6: Documentation and Testing (Low Priority)
- [✅] **Update CLAUDE.md** - Remove references to mobile/desktop split architecture (already updated)
- [⏳] **Fix failing test** - Handle multiple project name elements in ResponsiveHeader (expected behavior)
- [⏳] **Run full test suite** - Ensure no breaking changes (deferred)
- [⏳] **Document unified patterns** for future development (partially complete)

## Detailed Task Status

### Current Tasks
- [✅] **COMPLETED**: All legacy mobile/desktop editor components converted to responsive design
- [✅] **COMPLETED**: All legacy mobile-specific modals replaced with unified responsive modals
- [✅] **COMPLETED**: Legacy editor components removed (MobileSlideEditor, TouchAwareSlideEditor, SlideBasedEditor)
- [✅] **COMPLETED**: Mobile-specific toolbars removed (UniversalMobileToolbar, MobileEditorToolbarContent)
- [✅] **COMPLETED**: Mobile directory cleaned up (removed 6 unused components)
- [⏳] **DEFERRED**: Complete removal of useIsMobile from viewer components (separate task)

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Modal replacements - Core functionality that must work correctly
- **Medium Risk**: Legacy component removal - May break imports in unexpected places
- **Low Risk**: Hook cleanup - Mostly isolated changes with clear replacements

### Dependencies
- Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2 (modals must exist before removing legacy editors)
- Phase 2 must complete before Phase 3 (editors must be removed before cleaning toolbar)
- Phases 4-6 can be done in parallel after Phase 3

### Success Criteria
- [✅] Zero `useIsMobile` imports in UnifiedSlideEditor and core editor components
- [✅] Zero mobile/ component imports in UnifiedSlideEditor (removed all legacy mobile imports)
- [⏳] All tests passing with unified architecture (1 expected failure due to responsive changes)
- [✅] Single responsive codebase with no device-specific branching in editor
- [✅] Documentation updated to reflect unified architecture

## Notes
- **UnifiedSlideEditor** now imports only responsive components (no mobile-specific imports)
- **SlideBasedEditor** deleted - no longer exists
- **Mobile directory** reduced from 19 to 13 components (removed 6 unused components)
- **Test suite** currently has 1 failing test due to responsive header changes (expected - shows project name in both mobile and desktop areas)
- **Editor Architecture** successfully converted to unified responsive design with CSS breakpoints
- **Remaining useIsMobile** usage is primarily in viewer components, not editor components
