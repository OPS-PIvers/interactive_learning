The goal is to streamline the interface, making the slide editor the primary focus, and removing any elements that cause unnecessary visual clutter or scrolling, while adding essential new features.

*   **Overall Layout & Spacing:**
    *   **Prioritize Slide Editor Area:** Ensure the central "Slide Editor" area takes up the maximum available space horizontally and vertically, given the requirement for no scrolling. This might involve reducing the width of the left and right panels if they contain excessive empty space or non-critical information.
    *   **Dynamic Panel Sizing:** Consider if the left and right panels can dynamically adjust their width or be collapsed/expanded to prioritize the slide view when not actively being used for navigation or property editing.

*   **Top Toolbar/Navigation Bar (Sticky):**
    *   **Actionable Back Button:** As previously noted, ensure the "Back" button functions correctly and provides a clear navigation path.
    *   **Remove Redundancies:** Confirm the removal of the "Add Hotspot" button from this top bar.
    *   **Remove Zoom Controls:** Eliminate the "Q", "NaN%", "Q", "Reset", and "Center" zoom controls, as they are now irrelevant.
    *   **Functional Settings Button:** Fix the "Settings" button to prevent component errors and redirects. Its placement seems appropriate for global settings.
    *   **Consolidate Save:** The "Save" button is prominently displayed, which is good.

*   **Left Panel (Slides/Navigation):**
    *   **Concise Slide Listing:** Instead of just "Sample Project - Interactive Slide", if there will be multiple slides, consider displaying compact slide thumbnails or a list of slide titles. The current view only shows one slide with "0 elements," which is not very informative if multiple slides exist.
    *   **Efficient Slide Addition:** The "+ Add" button is clear for adding new slides. Ensure its placement doesn't cause vertical scrolling if many slides are present (e.g., consider a scrollable sub-area for slide thumbnails *if* scrolling is absolutely unavoidable for numerous slides, but the primary editor area must remain scroll-free).
    *   **Clear Mode Switching:** The "Preview Mode" button is good for toggling view modes. Its placement under the slide list is intuitive.
    *   **Remove Extraneous Labels:** The "Slides" header seems slightly redundant given the panel's content; it could potentially be removed for more vertical space if needed, or made less prominent.

*   **Right Panel (Properties/Elements):**
    *   **Streamlined Element Addition:**
        *   The buttons "+ Hotspot", "+ Text", "+ Shape" are well-placed here for adding elements *to the current slide*.
        *   If the "Add Hotspot" from the top toolbar is removed, ensure the "+ Hotspot" here is the primary method for adding them.
        *   Consider adding an "Add Image" or "Add Media" button if those are common elements.
    *   **Contextual Properties Display:**
        *   The "Properties" header is clear.
        *   The placeholder text "Select an element to edit its p" indicates the panel is empty when nothing is selected. When an element *is* selected, ensure that all its properties fit within this panel without any vertical scrollbar appearing. This is critical for the "no scrolling" requirement.
        *   **Expandable/Collapsible Sections:** For properties that might be extensive, use collapsible sections (e.g., "Style," "Content," "Interactions") to manage complexity and reduce perceived clutter without introducing a scrollbar.
    *   **No Scrolling within Panel:** Crucially, eliminate the visible scrollbar on the far right of this panel. This means its content must be designed to fit the available vertical space, potentially by compacting fields or using tabbed interfaces for very dense properties.

*   **Middle Panel (Slide Editor - The Canvas):**
    *   **Maximize Real Estate:** This area should dynamically resize to fill all available space once the left and right panels, and the top/bottom toolbars, are optimized.
    *   **Clean Headers:** The "Slide Editor" header and "1 SLIDES" indicator above the canvas provide context. While minor, consider if "Slide Editor" is necessary if the entire screen's context is clear. The "1 SLIDES" is useful as a quick count.
    *   **Center Alignment:** Ensure the actual slide content within this canvas area is visually centered, even if it doesn't fill the entire canvas (e.g., if a slide is designed at a 16:9 aspect ratio, it should be centered horizontally and vertically within the editor's view).
    *   **Aspect Ratio Selector:**
        *   **Placement:** Implement a clear, accessible aspect ratio selector (e.g., a dropdown or set of buttons with common ratios like 16:9, 4:3, 9:16 for mobile). This should be located near the top of the Slide Editor canvas or in a dedicated "Slide Settings" section.
        *   **Functionality:** Allow the editor to set the canvas's aspect ratio. This ensures creators can design for specific viewports (e.g., desktop monitors or standard phone screens).
        *   **Viewer Benefit:** When this slide is viewed on a device that matches the set aspect ratio (e.g., a mobile phone viewing a 9:16 slide), the content should fit their screen perfectly without any scrolling, cropping, or display issues. The boundaries of the slide should always be fully visible within the editor based on the selected aspect ratio.
    *   **Background Setting Options:**
        *   **Clear Access:** Provide a dedicated and clear control for setting the slide's background, likely within the properties panel when the slide itself (not an element on it) is selected.
        *   **Media Options:** Offer robust options for background media:
            *   **Upload:** Allow users to upload their own image or video files.
            *   **Camera:** Enable direct capture of images or videos using the device's camera.
            *   **Link:** Support embedding external media, specifically YouTube links for video backgrounds.
    *   **Audio Setting Options:**
        *   **Clear Access:** Provide a distinct control for adding background audio to the slide, similar to background media settings.
        *   **Audio Options:** Offer flexible methods for adding audio:
            *   **Upload:** Allow users to upload their own audio files.
            *   **Record:** Enable direct recording of audio within the editor.
            *   **Link:** Support linking to external audio sources (e.g., sound clips, music).

*   **Stylized Timeline:**
    *   **Integration:** The stylized timeline from the previous build must be fully integrated into both the **editor** and the **viewer**.
    *   **Editor Functionality:** In the editor, this timeline should provide a visual representation of elements over time, allowing for precise control over their entry, exit, and animation timings within the slide. It should not cause the main slide editor area to scroll, perhaps being a dedicated section below the main canvas or within a collapsible panel.
    *   **Viewer Functionality:** In the viewer, the timeline should offer an intuitive and visually appealing way for users to navigate through the interactive elements and progression of the slide, enhancing the user experience.
