Product Requirements Document: Interactive Hotspot Onboarding App (Comprehensive)Version: 2.0Date: August 27, 2025Status: Final Draft1. Overview & VisionThis document provides a comprehensive specification for a web-based application enabling users to create and share interactive, image-based guided walkthroughs. The application is designed to be a powerful tool for product onboarding, feature tutorials, visual training guides, and interactive presentations. It will serve two distinct user personas: Creators, who build the walkthroughs, and Viewers, who consume them. The core of the application is a "guided learning" experience, leading Viewers through a predefined sequence of interactive hotspots to deliver information contextually and effectively.2. Goals & ObjectivesPrimary Goal: To provide the most intuitive and efficient platform for creating and experiencing interactive, image-based walkthroughs that drive user understanding and engagement.Creator-Focused Objectives:To provide a frictionless image upload and setup process, allowing a Creator to start building within seconds.To offer a powerful yet simple-to-use editor with a rich set of configurable events and styling options for hotspots.To ensure the process of sequencing and organizing the learning path is visual, intuitive, and flexible.Viewer-Focused Objectives:To deliver a clean, accessible, and engaging guided experience that works flawlessly on any modern desktop or mobile device.To provide clear, unambiguous navigation and progress indicators that empower the Viewer to understand their place in the walkthrough.Business Objectives:To establish a "share anywhere" model with unique, public URLs for maximum distribution and reach.To build a scalable and maintainable platform that can support future feature enhancements like analytics, collaboration, and advanced event types.3. User Personas3.1 The Creator ("Sarah the Product Manager")Role: Product Manager at a SaaS company.Goal: To create an onboarding tutorial for a new feature in her company's software. She wants to visually guide new users through the interface, explaining key functions step-by-step.Needs: A tool that is fast, requires no coding, allows her to place explanatory text directly onto screenshots of her product, and can be easily shared with new users via a link. She is moderately tech-savvy but values simplicity and efficiency over a complex feature set.3.2 The Viewer ("David the New User")Role: A new customer trying to learn the software Sarah manages.Goal: To quickly understand how to use the new feature so he can complete his work.Needs: A clear, concise, and interactive guide that he can follow at his own pace. He is accessing the tutorial on his tablet and expects a smooth, mobile-friendly experience. He gets frustrated by confusing interfaces and lengthy text documents.4. Key Features & Specifications4.1 The Creator Experience (Editor Interface)The editor is the core of the creation process. It will be a single-page application view where the Creator manages the image, hotspots, and sequence.4.1.1 Image Upload & ManagementInterface: A prominent drag-and-drop area and a "Select File" button styled as a Primary CTA (background: #2d3f89, color: #ffffff).Supported Formats: JPEG, PNG, SVG. The system will validate the file type client-side and show an error message if an unsupported format is used. Error messages will appear in a Warning/Important Callout Box (border: #ad2122, background: #e5c7c7).File Size Limit: 10MB. A client-side check will prevent upload initiation for larger files, displaying the error: "Image exceeds the 10MB size limit."Image Optimization: Upon successful upload, the backend will process the image to create several optimized versions (e.g., small, medium, large thumbnails and a web-optimized full-size version) to ensure fast load times for Viewers on all devices.Replace Image: A "Replace Image" button will be available in the editor's main toolbar, allowing the Creator to swap the background image without losing their placed hotspots.4.1.2 Hotspot Creation & PlacementPlacement: A single click or tap on the image canvas places a new hotspot at that coordinate. The hotspot will appear with its default styling.Repositioning: Hotspots can be dragged and dropped to any location on the image. The cursor will change to a "move" icon on hover.Default Hotspot Style: A 24x24 pixel circular element with a solid fill of Primary Blue (#2d3f89) and a subtle pulsing animation on its border using Gray Light (#999999).4.1.3 Hotspot Configuration PanelClicking an existing hotspot opens a configuration modal or sidebar. This panel will use Form Elements styling (field borders: #999999, focus state: #2d3f89).Panel Sections:Styling:Pulse Animation: A toggle switch (On/Off). On by default.Color Palette: A selection of 8 predefined color swatches from the style guide: Primary Blue (#2d3f89), Blue Dark (#1d2a5d), Blue Light (#4356a0), Primary Red (#ad2122), Red Dark (#7a1718), Primary Gray (#666666), Gray Dark (#333333), Gray Light (#999999).Hide After Trigger: A checkbox (Off by default). If checked, the hotspot will become invisible to the Viewer after they trigger its event and move to the next step.Event:Trigger: A dropdown menu with three options: "On Click," "On Touch," "On Hover." "On Click" is the default. If "On Hover" is chosen, a tooltip will advise that this may not be suitable for mobile-only experiences.Event Type: A dropdown menu to select the event:Text Pop-up:Presents a rich text editor (supporting bold, italics, links) for the modal content.Modal styling: background: #eaecf5, border: #2d3f89, text: #333333 as per "Quote Blocks."Text on Image:Presents a plain text input for the tooltip content.An additional dropdown will allow the Creator to choose the tooltip's position relative to the hotspot (e.g., Top, Bottom, Left, Right).Pan/Zoom to Hotspot:A slider allows the Creator to define the zoom level (e.g., 1.2x to 3x).An optional text input for a banner overlay.Spotlight:Radio buttons to select shape (Circle or Rectangle).A slider to define the size/radius of the shape.A slider (10% to 90%) to define the dimming percentage of the Blue Dark (#1d2a5d) overlay.4.1.4 Walkthrough Sequencing PanelA dedicated panel (e.g., a sidebar) will list all created hotspots.Each item in the list will display the hotspot number and a user-defined title (e.g., "Step 1: Click the File Menu").The list will be re-orderable via drag-and-drop to define the learning sequence.A "Delete" icon (Primary Red #ad2122) will be present for each hotspot in this list, with a confirmation modal ("Are you sure you want to delete this hotspot?") to prevent accidental deletion.4.1.5 Saving & SharingSave: A "Save" button will persist the walkthrough state. The application will also feature auto-saving after every change, with a subtle "All changes saved" text indicator.Share: A "Share" button, styled as a Primary CTA (#2d3f89), will open a modal.Share Modal: This modal will display the unique, permanent URL. It will include a "Copy Link" button that, when clicked, copies the URL to the clipboard and displays a temporary confirmation message ("Link copied to clipboard!").4.2 The Viewer Experience (Guided Learning Interface)The viewer interface is a clean, read-only presentation of the walkthrough, prioritizing the content and guided flow.4.2.1 Initial LoadThe application loads the image and the hotspot data associated with the unique URL.The view automatically centers on the first hotspot in the sequence.The first hotspot is styled in its "In Progress" state.4.2.2 Navigation ElementsTimeline: A horizontal bar at the bottom of the screen.The track of the timeline will be Gray Lighter (#cccccc).The progress bar indicating completed steps will be Primary Blue (#2d3f89).Each hotspot will be represented by a circular indicator on the timeline. Clicking an indicator will navigate to that step.Navigation Buttons:"Previous" and "Next" buttons styled as Secondary buttons (background: #999999, color: #ffffff).The "Previous" button is disabled on the first step. The "Next" button is disabled until the event for the current step has been triggered. Once the event is triggered, the "Next" button becomes active. On the final step, it changes to a "Finish" button styled as a Primary CTA (#2d3f89).4.2.3 State-Based Styling & InteractionCompleted State: Hotspots and timeline indicators for previous steps will be styled with Gray Light (#999999). They remain clickable to allow the Viewer to review past steps.In Progress State: The current, active hotspot and its timeline indicator will be styled with Primary Red (#ad2122) to draw immediate attention. It will also have the pulse animation (if enabled by the Creator).Upcoming State: Hotspots and timeline indicators for future steps will be styled with Gray Lighter (#cccccc). They are not interactive until the Viewer progresses to that step.Event Triggering: The Viewer interacts with the "In Progress" hotspot using the trigger defined by the Creator (click, touch, or hover). Once the event is triggered (e.g., the pop-up is displayed and closed), the step is marked as complete, and the "Next" button becomes active.5. Non-Functional Requirements5.1 PerformanceInitial Load Time: The viewer page should load and become interactive in under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.Image Loading: Images must be lazy-loaded and optimized to prevent layout shift and reduce bandwidth.Responsiveness: UI interactions (e.g., opening a modal, panning) should feel instantaneous (<100ms response time).5.2 ScalabilityThe backend infrastructure must support a minimum of 1,000 concurrent viewers for a single shared walkthrough.Image hosting must be on a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to ensure fast delivery globally.5.3 SecurityAll data transmission between the client and server will be over HTTPS.Input sanitization will be implemented on all user-provided text (in pop-ups, tooltips) to prevent XSS attacks.5.4 Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)Keyboard Navigation: All interactive elements, including hotspots, timeline indicators, and modal controls, must be fully navigable and operable via the keyboard (Tab for focus, Enter/Space to activate).Screen Reader Support: ARIA attributes will be used to describe the state of hotspots (e.g., aria-label="Step 1 of 5: Completed"), the content of modals, and the function of all controls.Focus Management: When a modal (Text Pop-up) opens, focus must be trapped within it. When it closes, focus must return to the element that opened it.Color Contrast: All text and UI elements will meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1, as defined by WCAG 2.1 AA standards, using the provided style guide colors.6. Technical Specifications6.1 FrontendFramework: React.js (or Vue.js) for a component-based, declarative UI.State Management: React Context API for simple state or Zustand/Redux for more complex state.Styling: Styled-components or Tailwind CSS to implement the design system based on the style guide.6.2 BackendLanguage/Framework: Node.js with Express.js for a lightweight and scalable API.Database: Firestore or MongoDB (NoSQL) to store the flexible structure of walkthrough data (image references, hotspot coordinates, event configurations, sequence array).Image Handling: A service like AWS S3 with Lambda functions (or Cloudinary) to handle image uploads, optimization, and serving via a CDN.6.3 Data Model (Example){
