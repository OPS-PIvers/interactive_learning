# Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
Successfully identified and fixed 3 significant bugs in the interactive training module codebase:

## ✅ Bug #1: Memory Leak in VideoPlayer Component
**File**: `src/client/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`
**Issue**: Missing fullscreen event listener cleanup causing memory leaks
**Fix Applied**: 
- Added proper `fullscreenchange` event listener with cleanup
- Improved error handling in `toggleFullscreen` function
- Fixed state synchronization issues

## ✅ Bug #2: Logic Error in Data Sanitizer  
**File**: `src/lib/dataSanitizer.ts`
**Issue**: Vulnerability allowing undefined values for required fields to be passed to Firebase
**Fix Applied**:
- Added validation to ensure required fields exist before returning sanitized data
- Implemented proper error handling with descriptive error messages
- Enhanced sanitization logic to prevent Firebase WriteBatch operation failures
- Fixed object spread order to maintain data integrity

## ✅ Bug #3: Performance Issues in TouchGestures Hook
**File**: `src/client/hooks/useTouchGestures.ts` 
**Issue**: Race conditions, missing error boundaries, inadequate cleanup, and unthrottled touch events
**Fix Applied**:
- Added gesture cleanup function with proper error handling
- Implemented try-catch blocks around touch event handlers
- Enhanced useEffect cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Improved gesture state management
- **Added throttling (16ms/60fps) for touch move events to prevent UI freezing**
- Separated heavy calculations into internal handler for better performance

## Impact Assessment
- **Security**: Prevented memory leak DoS conditions
- **Performance**: Eliminated UI freezing and improved responsiveness  
- **Reliability**: Fixed data corruption issues and state synchronization problems

All fixes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving application stability.
