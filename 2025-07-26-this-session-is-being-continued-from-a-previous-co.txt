> There's a strange pulsing cross-hair cursor when I click the hotspot with the pan zoom.  Can we eliminate 
  that?  Also, the spotlight still is not aligned AND the square container outline of the hotspots themslves 
  are still much too large.  it's like a hash line square -- what even is that?? When I click the hotspot 
  there's a solid line border square around the circle which seems like the container...so what is the large 
  hash line square?

● I'll investigate these issues with the pan & zoom hotspot behavior and visual containers. Let me examine the
   current code to understand what's causing these problems.

● Now I understand the issues! Let me analyze what I've found:

  Analysis of the Issues

  1. Pulsing Crosshair Cursor: In SlideEditor.tsx, there's a target crosshair indicator for pan & zoom
  interactions that includes animate-ping, which creates the pulsing effect the user sees when clicking a
  hotspot with pan & zoom interaction.
  2. Spotlight Still Not Aligned: The spotlight positioning calculation is still using the element's top-left
  corner instead of calculating the visual center properly.
  3. Large Hash Line Square: This is the selection guideline in SlideEditor.tsx that appears when an element
  is selected. It's a purple dashed border (border: '2px dashed #a855f7') that shows around the selected
  element's container.
  4. Container Size Mismatch: The hotspot visual circle is much smaller than its container, creating a large
  invisible clickable area around the small circle.
                                                                                                              
●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Fix Pan & Zoom and Visual Issues

    Issues to Address:

    1. Remove Pulsing Crosshair: Remove the animate-ping class from the pan & zoom crosshair indicator that 
    creates the annoying pulsing effect
    2. Fix Spotlight Alignment: Update spotlight positioning to use the hotspot's visual center instead of 
    container top-left
    3. Remove Large Hash Selection Border: Either remove or make the selection guideline less intrusive - the 
    large purple dashed border is confusing
    4. Fix Hotspot Container Sizing: Make hotspot containers match their visual size exactly to prevent large 
    invisible clickable areas

    Implementation Plan:

    1. SlideEditor.tsx Changes:
      - Remove animate-ping from the crosshair indicator div
      - Fix spotlight center calculation to account for hotspot visual center  
      - Either remove the selection guidelines or make them match the visual bounds
      - Ensure hotspot containers use the actual hotspot dimensions instead of arbitrary container sizes
    2. Visual Consistency:
      - Make sure the clickable area matches what users see visually
      - Ensure interactions feel precise and responsive
      - Remove visual distractions that don't add value

    This will result in a much cleaner, more precise interaction experience where what users see is exactly 
    what they can interact with.
