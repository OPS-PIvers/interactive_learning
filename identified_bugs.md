# Identified Bugs - Interactive Learning Hub

## âœ… **RECENTLY FIXED BUGS** 

### **âœ… Rendering Logic in `MobileEventRenderer.tsx` Blocked Visual Events** - FIXED
- **Priority:** Critical (WAS)
- **Impact:** Prevented visual overlay events (Pan, Zoom, Spotlight) from rendering when a modal event is active.
- **Resolution:** Updated `activeEvents` logic to allow visual events to render simultaneously with modal events while preventing duplicates.

### **âœ… Flawed Transform Logic in `MobilePanZoomHandler.tsx`** - FIXED
- **Priority:** High (WAS)
- **Impact:** Caused unpredictable pan and zoom animations on mobile devices.
- **Resolution:** Complete rewrite using state-based transforms instead of direct DOM manipulation. Now uses React state management for reliable transform handling.

### **âœ… Z-Index Management in `MobileEventRenderer.tsx`** - FIXED
- **Priority:** High (WAS)
- **Impact:** Caused visual events to be hidden behind other elements.
- **Resolution:** Implemented proper z-index management using constants and clear hierarchy for modal vs visual events.

### **âœ… Incorrect Spotlight Rendering in `MobileSpotlightOverlay.tsx`** - FIXED
- **Priority:** Medium (WAS)
- **Impact:** Affected the rendering of rectangular spotlights.
- **Resolution:** Complete rewrite using Canvas API for reliable cross-browser spotlight rendering, replacing unreliable CSS gradient approach.

### **âœ… Spotlight was Not Interactive** - FIXED
- **Priority:** Medium (WAS)
- **Impact:** Prevented users from interacting with the spotlight.
- **Resolution:** Implemented proper pointer events and click handling with dedicated tap overlay for user interaction.

### **âœ… Improper Cleanup in `MobilePanZoomHandler.tsx`** - FIXED
- **Priority:** Low (WAS)
- **Impact:** Could lead to memory leaks.
- **Resolution:** Fixed useEventCleanup hook usage and implemented proper cleanup with state management instead of DOM manipulation.
