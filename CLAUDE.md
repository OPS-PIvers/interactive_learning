# CLAUDE.md - Bug Analysis & Fix Plan

## Project Overview
Interactive Learning Hub - A web application for creating interactive multimedia training modules with hotspot-based learning experiences. The mobile editing functionality has been fully implemented and is working correctly. This document now focuses on bug fixes and code quality improvements.

## Current Architecture Context
- **Main Component**: `src/client/components/InteractiveModule.tsx` - Core container handling both editing and viewing modes
- **Mobile Detection**: Uses `useIsMobile()` hook with conditional rendering throughout
- **State Management**: React useState with complex state interdependencies
- **Touch Handling**: `useTouchGestures` hook for pan/zoom, separate pointer events for hotspot interaction
- **Modal System**: Dual system with `HotspotEditorModal` (primary) and `EnhancedModalEditorToolbar` (settings)

## 🚨 PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES (Immediate - Blocks Production)

### Issue 1: Memory Leaks from Event Listeners
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Application performance degradation
**Files**: 
- `src/client/components/InteractiveModule.tsx` (lines 984-1028)
- `src/client/hooks/useTouchGestures.ts` (lines 117, 242)
- `src/client/components/HotspotViewer.tsx` (lines 126-131, 147-148)

**Problems**:
- Global keyboard event listeners not properly cleaned up
- setTimeout references not cleared on unmount 
- Document event listeners added but not always removed

**Implementation**:
1. Add cleanup functions in useEffect return statements
2. Use useRef for timeout IDs and clear in cleanup
3. Ensure event listener removal in all code paths

**Fixes Applied**:
- **`src/client/components/InteractiveModule.tsx`**:
    - Ensured `successMessageTimeoutRef` (for save success message) is cleared in `handleSave` and in `useEffect` cleanup (related to `initialData` changes).
    - Ensured `applyTransformTimeoutRef` (for `applyTransform` function) is cleared in `applyTransform` and in `useEffect` cleanup (related to `initialData` changes).
    - Ensured `debouncedApplyTransformTimeoutRef` (for `debouncedApplyTransform`) is cleared in `debouncedApplyTransform` and in a dedicated `useEffect` cleanup.
    - Verified that the global keydown listener (`handleKeyDown`) was already correctly removed in `useEffect` cleanup.
    - Verified that `pulseTimeoutRef` (for timeline event `PULSE_HOTSPOT`) was already correctly cleared in `useEffect` cleanup.
    - Verified that `ResizeObserver` was already correctly disconnected in `useEffect` cleanup.
    - Verified that `useAutoSave` hook's internal timer was already correctly cleared.
- **`src/client/hooks/useTouchGestures.ts`**:
    - `doubleTapTimeoutRef`: Added ref for the `setTimeout` in `handleTouchStart` (for double-tap zoom animation). Timeout is cleared if a new double-tap starts or in a `useEffect` cleanup on unmount.
    - `touchEndTimeoutRef`: Added ref for the `setTimeout` in `handleTouchEnd` (for resetting transform state). Timeout is cleared if a new touch end starts or in a `useEffect` cleanup on unmount.
- **`src/client/components/HotspotViewer.tsx`**:
    - `holdTimeoutRef`: Ensured the `setTimeout` for hold-to-edit is cleared in `handlePointerUp`, if a drag starts, and in a `useEffect` cleanup on unmount.
    - Document Event Listeners (`pointermove`, `pointerup`):
        - Refactored `handlePointerDown` to use `useRef` for storing `pointerMove`, `pointerUp`, and `continueDrag` handler functions.
        - Ensured these listeners are explicitly removed in the main `pointerUp` handler.
        - Added a `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array to remove any lingering document event listeners and clear `holdTimeoutRef` when the `HotspotViewer` component unmounts. This covers cases where the component might unmount mid-interaction.

### Issue 2: TypeScript Type Safety Violations
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Runtime errors and type system bypass
**Files**:
- `src/client/components/EditableEventCard.tsx` (line 8)
- `src/client/components/EnhancedHotspotPreview.tsx` (lines 62, 190, 319)
- `src/client/components/InteractiveModule.tsx` (lines 1139, 1191, 1482)

**Problems**:
- Missing icon module causing build failures
- Read-only property mutation attempts
- Type mismatches in ImageTransformState with undefined handling

**Implementation**:
1. **Missing Icon Module:** Created `src/client/components/icons/EyeSlashIcon.tsx` based on `EyeIcon.tsx` to resolve the missing import in `EditableEventCard.tsx`.
2. **Read-only Ref Mutations:** Refactored `SpotlightHandles`, `TextHandles`, and `InteractivePanZoomArea` components within `EnhancedHotspotPreview.tsx`. Changed the pattern of assigning to `containerRef.current` directly after finding the container via `closest()`. The new approach involves:
    - Storing the `React.MouseEvent` from `onMouseDown` in a ref (`initialMouseDownEventRef`).
    - In the `useEffect` hook that sets up global `mousemove` and `mouseup` listeners (when `isDragging` is true):
        - Retrieving the draggable container element using `initialMouseDownEventRef.current.currentTarget.closest('.relative.bg-slate-700')`.
        - Storing this container element in a variable (`currentDragContainer`) local to the `useEffect`'s scope.
        - The `handleMouseMove` and `handleMouseUp` functions (defined within the same `useEffect`) now close over `currentDragContainer` to perform their calculations.
    - This avoids direct reassignment of a `useRef`'s `.current` property post-initialization for dynamic DOM elements, addressing the "read-only property mutation" concern.
3. **ImageTransformState Undefined Handling:** Reviewed usages of `ImageTransformState`, particularly its optional `targetHotspotId` property, in `InteractiveModule.tsx`. Found that the existing code correctly handles the optional nature of `targetHotspotId` with appropriate checks (e.g., `if (imageTransform.targetHotspotId)`) or by using it in contexts where `undefined` is permissible (e.g., `hotspots.find(h => h.id === imageTransform.targetHotspotId)`). No specific code changes were required for this sub-point as current implementations are type-safe.

### Issue 3: Missing ARIA Accessibility Support
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Legal compliance and usability
**Files**:
- `src/client/components/FileUpload.tsx` (lines 110-118)
- `src/client/components/HotspotViewer.tsx` (lines 200-202)
- Timeline and modal components throughout

**Problems**:
- No ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates
- File upload missing proper labeling
- Hotspots lack state information for screen readers

**Implementation**:
1. Add `aria-live="polite"` regions for timeline and hotspot changes
    - Initially, `aria-live="polite"` was added to the main container div in `src/client/components/HotspotViewer.tsx`. This was later removed as the div doesn't have direct text content that changes for screen readers.
2. Add comprehensive `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` attributes
    - In `src/client/components/FileUpload.tsx`:
        - The main clickable `div` now has an `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` (referencing the instruction paragraph).
        - The `div` also has `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}` for keyboard accessibility.
        - An `onKeyDown` handler was added to the `div` to trigger the file input on 'Enter' or 'Space' key press.
        - The hidden `input` element no longer has a redundant `aria-label`.
        - An `id` was added to the instruction paragraph to be referenced by `aria-describedby`.
3. Include `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected` states for interactive elements
    - Added `aria-pressed` to the hotspot button in `src/client/components/HotspotViewer.tsx`, indicating whether it is currently pressed or not (based on the `isHolding` state).

### Issue 4: Race Conditions in Touch Handling
**Priority**: CRITICAL - State corruption and user interaction failures
**Files**:
- `src/client/hooks/useTouchGestures.ts` (lines 216-249)
- `src/client/components/HotspotViewer.tsx` (pointer event handling)

**Problems**:
- Multiple setTimeout calls without cleanup causing state corruption
- Touch gesture end events can execute out of order
- Stale closures in event handlers

**Implementation**:
1. Implement timeout cleanup with proper ref management
2. Add gesture state coordination to prevent conflicts
3. Fix useCallback dependencies to prevent stale closures

## 🟡 PHASE 2: HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (Performance & UX)

### Issue 5: Performance Optimization
**Priority**: HIGH - User experience and responsiveness
**Files**:
- `src/client/components/InteractiveModule.tsx` (lines 59-92, 1020-1027)
- Multiple components missing React.memo

**Problems**:
- Expensive operations in render cycles
- Missing memoization opportunities
- Large dependency arrays triggering excessive re-renders

**Implementation**:
1. Add React.memo to pure components (InfoPanel, Timeline)
2. Optimize useEffect dependency arrays by splitting large effects
3. Move expensive calculations to useMemo or module level

### Issue 6: Focus Management & Keyboard Navigation
**Priority**: HIGH - Accessibility and user experience
**Files**:
- `src/client/components/MediaModal.tsx` (lines 47-57)
- Timeline and hotspot components

**Problems**:
- Focus not trapped in modals
- Missing skip navigation links
- Tab order issues in timeline controls

**Implementation**:
1. Implement focus trap with proper modal focus management
2. Add skip to content links for keyboard users
3. Use strategic tabindex and test keyboard navigation paths

### Issue 7: Browser Compatibility Gaps
**Priority**: HIGH - Cross-platform functionality
**Files**:
- `src/client/styles/mobile.css` (lines 29-32)
- `src/client/hooks/useTouchGestures.ts`

**Problems**:
- Modern CSS features without fallbacks (dvh, svh units)
- Pointer events not supported in all browsers
- ResizeObserver used without polyfill

**Implementation**:
1. Add CSS fallbacks with vh units for older browsers
2. Add touch event fallbacks for pointer event compatibility
3. Include polyfills for ResizeObserver and other modern APIs

## 🟠 PHASE 3: MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES (Security & Compatibility)

### Issue 8: Input Validation & Security
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Security hardening
**Files**:
- `src/client/components/FileUpload.tsx` (lines 49-64)
- Media URL handling throughout application

**Problems**:
- File upload only validates MIME types, not content
- Media URLs not validated before use
- Debug console logging in production

**Implementation**:
1. Add file signature validation and size limits
2. Whitelist URL protocols and validate before use
3. Remove debug logs or add conditional logging

### Issue 9: Error Boundary Enhancement
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Graceful degradation
**Files**:
- Component-level error boundaries needed
- `src/client/components/App.tsx` (async error handling)

**Problems**:
- Only app-level ErrorBoundary exists
- Some async operations lack error handling
- Limited user-friendly error messaging

**Implementation**:
1. Add ErrorBoundary around major component sections
2. Add try-catch blocks for async operations
3. Create user-friendly error messages for common failures

### Issue 10: Screen Reader & Semantic HTML
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Enhanced accessibility
**Files**:
- Multiple components using div instead of semantic elements
- Image alt text handling

**Problems**:
- Interactive elements use div instead of proper HTML
- Images lack descriptive alt text
- Missing semantic structure (nav, main, section)

**Implementation**:
1. Replace divs with button, nav, main, section elements
2. Require alt text input during image upload process
3. Add proper heading hierarchy and landmark navigation

## 🟢 PHASE 4: POLISH & TESTING (Long-term Quality)

### Issue 11: Comprehensive Testing Strategy
**Priority**: LOW - Quality assurance
**Implementation**:
1. Cross-browser testing suite setup
