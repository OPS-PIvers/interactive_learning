# CLAUDE.md - Interactive Learning Hub

## Project Overview
Interactive Learning Hub - A web application for creating interactive multimedia training modules with hotspot-based learning experiences. The project has undergone comprehensive improvements in accessibility, performance, and user experience.

## Current Architecture Context
- **Main Component**: `src/client/components/InteractiveModule.tsx` - Core container handling both editing and viewing modes
- **Mobile Detection**: Uses `useIsMobile()` hook with conditional rendering throughout
- **State Management**: React useState with complex state interdependencies
- **Touch Handling**: `useTouchGestures` hook for pan/zoom, separate pointer events for hotspot interaction
- **Modal System**: Dual system with `HotspotEditorModal` (primary) and `EnhancedModalEditorToolbar` (settings)
- **Accessibility**: `useScreenReaderAnnouncements` hook provides comprehensive screen reader support

## ðŸŽ‰ COMPLETED FEATURES & FIXES (July 2025)

All pending PRs have been successfully reviewed, improved, and merged to main. The project now includes significant enhancements in multiple areas:

### âœ… **Major Features Implemented**

#### 1. **Automatic Thumbnail Generation (PR #79)**

- Optimized `App.tsx` for better UI responsiveness during saves

#### 2. **Enhanced Mobile User Experience (PRs #82, #83)**
- **Debounced text input** in mobile hotspot editor (500ms delay) prevents excessive API calls
- **Extended save success feedback** with 2.5-second visual confirmation
- **Improved button states** with proper disabled states during operations
- **Memory leak prevention** with proper timeout cleanup

**Technical Implementation:**
- `lodash.debounce` integration for performance optimization

#### 3. **Comprehensive ARIA Accessibility (PRs #80, #81)**
- **Screen reader announcements** for drag operations and state changes
- **Complete ARIA attribute support** including `aria-grabbed`, `aria-dropeffect`
- **Live regions** for polite and assertive announcements
- **Semantic HTML improvements** throughout the application
- **Keyboard navigation support** with proper focus management

**Technical Implementation:**
- New `src/client/hooks/useScreenReaderAnnouncements.ts` hook
- Enhanced `HotspotViewer.tsx` with full ARIA compliance
- Improved `FileUpload.tsx` with semantic button roles

### âœ… **Critical Issues Resolved**

- âœ… **Screen reader support** with comprehensive announcements
- âœ… **Refined screen reader announcement logic** for enhanced robustness and reliability
- âœ… **Keyboard navigation** throughout the application
- âœ… **Semantic HTML** with proper roles and landmarks

#### **Touch & Gesture Handling**
- âœ… **Race condition prevention** with proper state management
- âœ… **Gesture coordination** between touch, drag, and pointer events
- âœ… **Mobile-optimized thresholds** for reliable interaction
- âœ… **Memory leak prevention** in touch gesture timeouts

#### **Data Integrity & Consistency**
- âœ… **Firestore transactions** ensure atomic operations
- âœ… **Thumbnail synchronization** with background image changes
- âœ… **Error recovery** with proper fallback mechanisms
- âœ… **Optimistic UI updates** for immediate user feedback
