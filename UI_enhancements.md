## Global / Cross-Platform UI/UX Enhancements (Mobile & Desktop)

*   **Accessibility (WCAG Compliance):**
    *   **Comprehensive Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys). ⚠️ *Partially implemented - main container enhanced*
    *   **Screen Reader Support (ARIA Labels):** ✅ *Implemented* - Added proper ARIA attributes for main interactive elements, images, and dynamic content to provide meaningful context for screen reader users.
    *   **Color Contrast:** Verify sufficient color contrast ratios for all text and interactive elements against their backgrounds to meet WCAG AA standards.
    *   **Focus Management:** ✅ *Partially implemented* - Enhanced focus indicators for main container and keyboard navigation support.
*   **Performance & Responsiveness:**
    *   **Optimized Animations:** Ensure all animations are smooth (60fps) and performant, utilizing CSS transforms and opacity where possible. Avoid layout thrashing.
    *   **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images and media content to improve initial load times, especially on mobile networks.
    *   **Adaptive Image Delivery:** Use responsive image techniques (e.g., `srcset`, `<picture>`) to deliver appropriately sized images based on device and viewport.
    *   **Touch-Friendly Tap Targets:** Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) have a minimum tap target size of 44x44 CSS pixels for easy interaction on touch devices.
*   **Consistent Design Language:**
    *   **Unified Component Library:** Maintain a consistent visual style, spacing, typography, and interaction patterns across all components, regardless of platform.
    *   **Iconography:** Use a consistent set of icons that are clear, recognizable, and scale well across different resolutions.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:**
    *   **Toast Notifications:** ✅ *Implemented* - Replaced generic `alert()` calls with non-intrusive, dismissible toast notifications for success, warning, and error messages.
    *   **Skeleton Loaders:** ✅ *Implemented* - Added skeleton screens with shimmer effects to indicate loading progress, rather than just spinners.
*   **Empty States:**
    *   **Informative Empty States:** Provide clear, helpful messages and calls-to-action for sections or lists that are currently empty (e.g., "No hotspots yet. Click 'Add Hotspot' to get started!").

## Mobile UI/UX Enhancements

*   **General Modals (e.g., `AuthModal.tsx`, `MediaModal.tsx`):**
    *   **Responsive Sizing:** Ensure modals adapt better to very small screens, potentially using `max-w-[90vw]` or dynamic sizing based on viewport width, rather than fixed `max-w-md`.
    *   **Keyboard Handling:** Implement robust logic to prevent virtual keyboards from obscuring input fields within modals. This might involve scrolling the modal content or adjusting its height.
    *   **Password Visibility Toggle:** Add an eye icon to password input fields to allow users to toggle password visibility for better usability and error checking.
*   **Interactive Elements (e.g., `EditableEventCard.tsx`, `EventTypeSelector.tsx`):**
    *   **Enhanced Drag & Drop:** For `EditableEventCard`, consider implementing a long-press gesture to initiate dragging on mobile, providing clearer intent than a simple tap.
    *   **Dropdowns:** While native select elements are generally good on mobile, for custom dropdowns (like `EventTypeSelector`), ensure large, easily tappable areas and clear visual feedback on selection.
*   **Toolbars (`EditorToolbar.tsx`, `ViewerToolbar.tsx`):**
    *   **Haptic Feedback Consistency:** Ensure haptic feedback is consistently applied to all interactive elements (buttons, sliders) for a more tactile and responsive experience.
    *   **Save/Loading Indicators:** The current save/loading/success indicators are good; ensure they are highly visible and don't block critical content.
*   **Mobile Editor (`MobileEditorLayout.tsx`, `MobileEditorModal.tsx`, `MobileEditorTabs.tsx`, `MobileHotspotEditor.tsx`):**
    *   **Bottom Sheet Modals:** The use of bottom sheet modals (`MobileEditorModal`) is excellent for mobile. Ensure smooth animations and easy dismissal (e.g., swipe down).
    *   **Tab Navigation:** The tab bar in `MobileEditorTabs` is clear. Consider adding subtle animations or transitions when switching tabs for a more polished feel.
    *   **Hotspot Placement Feedback:** When in hotspot placement mode, provide clear visual cues (e.g., a crosshair cursor, a pulsating indicator) on the image to guide the user where to tap.
*   **Media Playback (`MobileMediaModal.tsx`):**
    *   **Full-Screen Media:** The full-screen media modal is appropriate. Ensure native controls are easily accessible and responsive.

## Desktop UI/UX Enhancements

*   **Toolbars (`EditorToolbar.tsx`, `ViewerToolbar.tsx`):**
    *   **Hover States:** Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, icons) have clear and consistent hover states to indicate interactivity.
    *   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Promote awareness of keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl/Cmd + +/-/0` for zoom) through tooltips or a dedicated help section to improve productivity for power users.
*   **Modals (`MediaModal.tsx`, `ShareModal.tsx`):**
    *   **Consistent Sizing:** While flexible sizing is good, ensure there's a consistent visual hierarchy and maximum width for modals to prevent them from becoming too wide on very large screens.
*   **Editor (`InteractiveModule.tsx`):**
    *   **Zoom Controls:** The zoom controls are functional. Consider adding a small visual indicator (e.g., a mini-map or a draggable rectangle) to show the current zoomed area relative to the full image, especially at high zoom levels.

## Viewer UI/UX Enhancements

*   **General:**
    *   **Loading States:** ✅ *Implemented* - Added more visually engaging loading states for modules and images, including skeleton screens and subtle animations.
    *   **Error Messages:** ✅ *Implemented* - Replaced generic `alert` messages with integrated and user-friendly toast notifications for errors (e.g., "Save failed").
*   **Hotspot Interactions:**
    *   **Clear Hotspot States:** Ensure clear visual feedback for hotspot states (e.g., hovered, active, completed).
    *   **Pan & Zoom Feedback:** ✅ *Implemented* - Enhanced pan & zoom system with better state management and visual feedback for active interactions.
    *   **Spotlight Effect:** ✅ *Implemented* - Improved spotlight effect with Canvas-based rendering for smooth and visually appealing transitions, especially on mobile.
*   **Timeline Navigation (`HorizontalTimeline.tsx`):**
    *   **Progress Indication:** Clearly show the user's progress through the timeline (e.g., filled dots, a progress bar).
    *   **Interactive Dots:** Ensure timeline dots are easily clickable/tappable and provide visual feedback on interaction.

## Editor UI/UX Enhancements

*   **General:**
    *   **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Implement a robust undo/redo system for all editing actions (hotspot creation, movement, event changes) to provide a safety net for users.
    *   **Save Feedback:** The "Saved!" message is good. Consider a more subtle, non-intrusive notification for successful saves.
*   **Hotspot Management:**
    *   **Hotspot List Filtering/Sorting:** For projects with many hotspots, add options to filter or sort the hotspot list (e.g., by name, by associated events) for easier management.
    *   **Bulk Actions:** Consider adding bulk actions for hotspots (e.g., delete multiple, move multiple) if the complexity of projects grows.
*   **Event Management (`EditableEventCard.tsx`, `MobileHotspotEditor.tsx`):**
    *   **Event Type Icons:** Enhance `EventTypeToggle` to use distinct icons for each `InteractionType` for quicker visual identification.
    *   **Event Reordering:** Ensure drag-and-drop reordering of events within the timeline is intuitive and provides clear visual feedback during the drag operation.
    *   **Preview Mode:** The individual event preview is useful. Ensure the transition between editing and previewing an event is seamless.
*   **Image Editing (`ImageEditCanvas.tsx`):**
    *   **Grid Overlay:** For precise hotspot placement, consider adding an optional grid overlay to the image editing canvas.
    *   **Ruler Guides:** Implement draggable ruler guides to assist with alignment.
*   **Form Inputs:**
    *   **Input Validation Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback for invalid input (e.g., red borders, error messages below the field) rather than just an `alert`.
    *   **Placeholder Text:** Ensure all input fields have clear and helpful placeholder text.
