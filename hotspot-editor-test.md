# Hotspot Editor Fix Test Results

## Test Steps:
1. Open the application at http://localhost:3002/
2. Create a new project or open an existing one
3. Add a hotspot to the image
4. Click on the hotspot in edit mode
5. Verify that the HotspotEditorModal opens

## Expected Behavior:
- Debug logs should appear in the console showing:
  - "Debug [HotspotViewer]: Hotspot clicked" with isEditing=true and hasOnEditRequest=true
  - "Debug [HotspotViewer]: Calling onEditRequest for hotspot [id]"
  - "Debug [InteractiveModule]: handleOpenHotspotEditor called" with hotspot details
  - "Debug [InteractiveModule]: Modal state updated for hotspot [id]"
- The HotspotEditorModal should open on the right side of the screen

## Fixed Issues:
1. **Stale Closure Bug**: Added missing dependencies (onEditRequest, isEditing) to handlePointerUp callback
2. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track the complete flow from hotspot click to modal open

## Files Modified:
- `/workspaces/interactive_learning/src/client/components/HotspotViewer.tsx` - Fixed dependency array and added debug logging
- `/workspaces/interactive_learning/src/client/components/InteractiveModule.tsx` - Added debug logging to handleOpenHotspotEditor

## Next Steps:
- Test manually by clicking hotspots in edit mode
- Remove debug logging once confirmed working
- Verify no regressions in viewer mode hotspot functionality
