| File Name/Path | Description | Usage Count | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `src/client/styles/CLAUDE.md` | Documentation for styles | 0 | Keep | This file provides useful documentation about the purpose of the `styles` directory. It should be kept. |
| `src/client/styles/custom-scrollbar.css` | Custom scrollbar styles | 1 | Keep | This file is imported in `src/client/index.css` and provides global scrollbar styles. It should be kept. |
| `src/client/styles/high-contrast.css` | High contrast theme styles | 1 | Keep | This file is imported in `src/client/index.css` and provides a high-contrast theme for accessibility. It should be kept. |
| `src/client/styles/slide-components.css` | Styles for slide components | 4 | Keep | This file is heavily used by slide components and is imported globally. It is essential for the slide-based architecture. |

## Overall Recommendations

1. All files in this directory are actively used and well-documented. No files are recommended for removal or consolidation.
2. The use of global CSS is minimal and justified for scrollbars, high-contrast themes, and the slide component architecture.
3. The `CLAUDE.md` file is a good practice and should be maintained.

## Implementation Notes

- No implementation is needed as all files are kept as is.
