## Summary

- **Total Files Audited:** 4
- **Files Kept As Is:** 0 (0%)
- **Files Updated:** 0 (0%)
- **Files Consolidated:** 0 (0%)
- **Files Removed:** 4 (100%)

| File Name/Path | Description | Usage Count | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `src/shared/demos/dummy.txt` | A dummy text file. | 0 | Remove | This file is a placeholder and is not used anywhere in the codebase. |
| `src/shared/demos/module.ts` | Contains demo data for an interactive module. | 0 | Remove | This file is unused and its functionality is likely superseded by `slideDeck.ts`. |
| `src/shared/demos/slideDeck.ts` | Exports a function to create a demo slide deck. | 0 | Remove | This file is unused. The demo data is not imported or used anywhere. |
| `src/shared/demos/test.ts` | Exports a function to create a slide deck for Playwright tests. | 0 | Remove | This file is not used in any tests or elsewhere in the application. |

## Overall Recommendations

1. **Remove all files:** The entire `src/shared/demos/` directory and its contents are unused and should be removed to reduce codebase clutter.
2. **Consolidate demo data:** If demo data is needed in the future, it should be co-located with the components or features that use it, or placed in a centralized, clearly named location.
3. **No action needed beyond removal:** Since none of these files are in use, no further code changes are required after their deletion.

## Implementation Notes

- No manual intervention is required. The files can be safely deleted.
- No dependencies need to be updated.
