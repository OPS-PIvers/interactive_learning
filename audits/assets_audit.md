## Overall Recommendations

1. **Remove unused documentation:** The `CLAUDE.md` file is not used and should be removed.
2. **Optimize images:** The `demo-background.jpg` should be optimized to reduce its file size.

## Implementation Notes

- The `CLAUDE.md` file can be safely deleted.
- The `demo-background.jpg` should be compressed.
