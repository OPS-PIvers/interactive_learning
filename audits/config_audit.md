| File Name/Path | Description | Usage Count | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `config/firestore.indexes.json` | Defines Firestore indexes for querying collections. | 1 | Keep | This is a standard and necessary configuration file for Firestore performance. No changes needed. |
| `config/mcp.json` | Configures the MCP server for Puppeteer. | 1 | Keep | This file is required for running the headless browser for tasks like generating screenshots or PDFs. No changes needed. |
| `config/metadata.json` | Contains metadata about the application. | 1 | Keep | This file provides essential metadata for the application. No changes needed. |
| `config/cors.json` | Defines the CORS policy for the application. | 1 | Update | The current policy is too permissive (`"origin": ["*"]`). It should be updated to a more restrictive policy for production environments, specifying allowed origins. |

## Overall Recommendations

1. **Restrict CORS Policy**: The `cors.json` file should be updated to specify allowed origins instead of using a wildcard. This is a security best practice.
2. **Review MCP Configuration**: The `mcp.json` file should be reviewed periodically to ensure the Puppeteer launch options are optimal and secure.
3. **No other major changes recommended**: The rest of the configuration files are standard and well-maintained.
