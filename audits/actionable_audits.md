# Actionable Audits

This file contains the audits that have been completed and are ready to be acted upon.

### 1. **Scripts Directory Audit** (`/scripts/`)
- **Priority**: High
- **Rationale**: Contains 20+ utility and testing scripts. Many appear to be legacy or development-only scripts that may no longer be needed.
- **Scope**: Automation scripts, testing utilities, MCP integration, Firebase utilities
- **Impact**: Medium-High - affects development workflow and automation
- **Audit File**: `audits/scripts_audit.md`
- **Recommendations**:
  - Remove 8 obsolete scripts.
  - Consolidate `console-monitor.js` and `analyze-console.js`.

### 2. **Tests Directory Audit** (`src/tests/`)
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Rationale**: Testing is fundamental to code quality. Need to audit test coverage, identify redundant tests, and ensure all critical functionality is tested.
- **Scope**: 30+ test files across multiple subdirectories (accessibility, buildIntegrity, coreFunctionality, integration, mobile-ux, performance)
- **Impact**: High - affects confidence in deployments and refactoring
- **Audit File**: `src/tests/tests_audit.md`
- **Recommendations**:
  - Update placeholder tests in `src/tests/accessibility/Accessibility.test.ts` and `src/tests/integration/DecomposedComponents.test.ts`.
  - Un-skip the test suites in `src/tests/integration/ConcurrentOperations.test.ts` and `src/tests/integration/FirebaseIntegration.test.ts`.
  - Implement the placeholder tests in `src/tests/performance/PerformanceRegression.test.ts`.
