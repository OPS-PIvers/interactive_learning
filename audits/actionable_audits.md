# Actionable Audits

This file contains the audits that have been completed and are ready to be acted upon.

### 1. **Tests Directory Audit** (`src/tests/`)
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Rationale**: Testing is fundamental to code quality. Need to audit test coverage, identify redundant tests, and ensure all critical functionality is tested.
- **Scope**: 30+ test files across multiple subdirectories (accessibility, buildIntegrity, coreFunctionality, integration, mobile-ux, performance)
- **Impact**: High - affects confidence in deployments and refactoring
- **Audit File**: `src/tests/tests_audit.md`
- **Recommendations**:
  - Update placeholder tests in `src/tests/accessibility/Accessibility.test.ts` and `src/tests/integration/DecomposedComponents.test.ts`.
  - Un-skip the test suites in `src/tests/integration/ConcurrentOperations.test.ts` and `src/tests/integration/FirebaseIntegration.test.ts`.
  - Implement the placeholder tests in `src/tests/performance/PerformanceRegression.test.ts`.

### 2. **Client Styles Audit** (`src/client/styles/`)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Rationale**: CSS files can contain duplicate or unused styles. Need consolidation analysis.
- **Scope**: Global styles, component-specific CSS, custom scrollbar styles, high-contrast styles
- **Impact**: Medium - affects styling consistency and bundle size
- **Audit File**: `audits/styles_audit.md`
- **Recommendations**:
  - No action is needed. The audit concluded that all files in this directory are actively used and well-documented.
