# Actionable Audits

This file contains the audits that have been completed and are ready to be acted upon.

### 1. **Tests Directory Audit** (`src/tests/`)
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Rationale**: Testing is fundamental to code quality. Need to audit test coverage, identify redundant tests, and ensure all critical functionality is tested.
- **Scope**: 30+ test files across multiple subdirectories (accessibility, buildIntegrity, coreFunctionality, integration, mobile-ux, performance)
- **Impact**: High - affects confidence in deployments and refactoring
- **Audit File**: `src/tests/tests_audit.md`
- **Recommendations**:
  - Update placeholder tests in `src/tests/accessibility/Accessibility.test.ts` and `src/tests/integration/DecomposedComponents.test.ts`.
  - Un-skip the test suites in `src/tests/integration/ConcurrentOperations.test.ts` and `src/tests/integration/FirebaseIntegration.test.ts`.
  - Implement the placeholder tests in `src/tests/performance/PerformanceRegression.test.ts`.

### 2. **Assets Directory Audit** (`src/client/assets/`)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Rationale**: Assets can accumulate over time. Need to identify unused images and optimize file sizes.
- **Scope**: Image files, CLAUDE.md documentation
- **Impact**: Medium - affects bundle size and load performance
- **Audit File**: `audits/assets_audit.md`
- **Recommendations**:
  - Remove unused documentation: The `CLAUDE.md` file is not used and should be removed.
  - Optimize images: The `demo-background.jpg` should be optimized to reduce its file size.
